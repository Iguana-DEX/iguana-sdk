## IguanaDEX SDK

Iguana Protocol is a community-driven protocol providing:
* AMMs on BNB Chain - most notably the DMI Pool tracking the Digital Market Index
* Perpetual Swaps trading on BNB Chain and the Polygon Network.

This SDK gives developers access to methods and examples for data formatting and transaction execution on IguanaDEX.

[balancer-js](./balancer-js/README.md) is a JavaScript SDK which provides commonly used utilities for interacting with IguanaDEX.

In order to get started with the IguanaDEX sdk, please run the following commands in a local directory of your choice:

```bash
